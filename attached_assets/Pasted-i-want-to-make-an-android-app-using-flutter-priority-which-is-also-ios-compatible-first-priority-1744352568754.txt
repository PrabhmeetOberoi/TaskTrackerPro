i want to make an android app using flutter (priority) which is also ios compatible , first priority is to have accessiblity to bluetooth of the device easily that is we want to connect a barcode printer using bluetooth to print labels.
firstly i will tell you the overview of the app and how it will work then we will move to the technical part.
Basically this aap is for a jain temple where the devotees will come and enter their unique devotee id , the devotee simply enters his or her id and clicks a button submit / print which firstly selects a random item out of 18 different items and displays that and a label is printed from the printer which has 3 things printed: the devotee id, the item selected and the date of that day.
second main feature will be for the admin to see a dashboard where he can see the entire report may it be day wise, month wise , year wise, or devotee wise which devotee is regular or not and may be show a calendar with dates of visit marked as green and days of absence unmarked or marked red.
basically the admin needs to see overall report, and this dashboard page will require a user authentication
admin will also have a page to add new devotees
now ill give a jist of the ui that i want, (all ui in English) , first we will have a home page with welcome message and a login button which redirects to login page, then the admin needs to login once to activate the application, then we get 2 options one is devotee page another is dashboard , for dashboard we need a user authentication once more , this can be different or same according to the clients requirement, the devotee page will have a input for devotee id and a ui with number buutons like a dialpad which will directly enter the id into the input field, no need for keyboard to show up, next there will be a single submit button which displays the selected random item with some animation(optional) and send the print command to the connected printer,now ill give a jist of the ui that i want, first we will have a home page with welcome message and a login button which redirects to login page, then the admin needs to login once to activate the application, then we get 2 options one is devotee page another is dashboard , for dashboard we need a user authentication once more , this can be different or same according to the clients requirement, the devotee page will have a input for devotee id and a ui with number buutons like a dialpad which will directly enter the id into the input field, no need for keyboard to show up, next there will be a single submit button which displays the selected random item with some animation(optional) and send the print command to the connected printer,
the printer command will be a prn which will be generated using a prn template and just the variables will be replaced
then we will have a hamburger menu in devotee page which on click shows a dropdown of options, first one will be to scan and connect a printer, the button on click first scans nearby bluetooth devices and lists them in a pop up window like a modal and the user selects the required device and it gets connected, in the hamburger menu second thing will be the name of the printer connected if already connected or show the status that no device is connected, lastly it will have a go to main screen or home page button

talking about tech, i want to use python (preferrably) and for database and backend you can use whatever you want for easy use , you can structure it in a way that the reports can be viewed from another device as well depending upon the ease of use and work

i want a nice clean and structured code for better understanding
